    "# Winning Jeopardy: A Statistical Analysis\n",
    "## Data Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, titled **Winning Jeopardy**, the focus is on analyzing the American TV show Jeopardy. This program, a notable fixture in U.S. popular culture, is well-known for its challenging trivia questions and the appeal of cash prizes. The objective is to identify patterns within the questions that may provide contestants with a strategic advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis utilizes a dataset named `jeopardy.csv`, which includes 20,000 rows sampled from a comprehensive collection of Jeopardy questions. Each row represents a single question from a specific episode of the show, reflecting the diverse and complex nature of the game's format. The dataset is available for download at [this link https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following key columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show Number**: A unique identifier for each Jeopardy episode.\n",
    "- **Air Date**: The date when the episode was broadcast.\n",
    "- **Round**: The round of Jeopardy during which the question was asked.\n",
    "- **Category**: The thematic category of the question.\n",
    "- **Value**: The monetary value awarded for a correct answer.\n",
    "- **Question**: The text of the trivia question posed to the contestants.\n",
    "- **Answer**: The correct response to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights that could inform strategies for succeeding on Jeopardy."
